				Fire poses a tremendous safety risk for any business, workplace or organization – one of the biggest safety issues we see, in fact, yet one that is sometimes overlooked or underestimated.
				<br>
				An important aspect of any prevention process requires the full awareness of the risks and impacts. Fire safety awareness is the important starting point in an integrated fire safety plan for every business.
				<br>
				We will specifically explain what to do when a building is on fire, and what to do before, during, and after the fire.

				<h1><b>What can I do to prepare for a fire?</b></h1>
					<div class="row">

						<div class="col-9">
							The first task you should do beforehand is to not even cause the problem in the first place.
							You shoud be checking for any flammable objects and keep them in areas where they aren't prone to burning. You should also put away any flammable objects from things like an oven, or a stove.
							You should also check falty wiring and make sure that a spark would not be caused at all, as well as no flammable liquid leaking at the building.<br>
							The second line of defense is to make sure you at least conduct a fire drill test for safety reasons. Look at the building and see if there's any fire exits. And see if your location in the building is conveinent enough for you to escape from a raging fire.<br>
							Lastly, try to add things like fire extinguishers and water sprinklers so that you can maximize your chances of survivng if you do encounter your building in fire.
						</div>
					</div>
					<br>
				<h1><b>Alright, I did the precautions but theres a fire. What do I do?</b></h1>	
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-8">
							Do not try to enter an elavator. Fires can break the electronics and thus could lead to a fast descent into what most likely could be your death.<br>
							Try to avoid fire as much as you can, or if you are stuck, try to see if there is a fire extinguisher you can use.<br>
							Call the firefighters as soon as possible as the sooner you do, the better.<br>
							Prioritize yourself and your family over your possessions.<br>
							And, try to exit the building as soon as possible. You don't want to inhale that smoke for too long.

							Do not re-enter the building yet.
							Wait for the authorities to give the signal.<br>
							When rentering, do not try to step to any puddle which is near a wire.<br>
							Stay clear of any inflammable material and safely put them away from harm.
